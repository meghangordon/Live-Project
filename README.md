# Live Project: Plant Library

### The Plant Library allows users to input plants that they have in their collection along with the care information that the plant needs. 
### Users will input water needs, sunlight needs, and where it is located. 


### Once a plant has been added to the library, users will be able to view the items within the library and click on the plant cards for more care information.
